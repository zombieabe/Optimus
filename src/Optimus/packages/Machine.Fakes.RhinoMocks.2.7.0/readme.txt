Machine.Fakes needs your help!
------------------------------

You are using Machine.Fakes. Great!
Please consider keeping Machine.Fakes alive by taking over its maintenance.
I cannot maintain it any more and am looking for a new owner.
It does not require any big work - just some minor regular care.

Have a look at the code base and contact me on GitHub or Twitter (@SimonHoh).
