# Optimus
Cause it's all about the primes

This is just a simple exercise.
Build all and run Optimus.exe

Happy with:
The output of the application works.
Seems to work with some relative speed.
Good coverage for the core pieces of the application.

Stuff that could be improved:
A decent output model for the matrix.
